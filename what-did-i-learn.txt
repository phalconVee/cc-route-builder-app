What Did I Learn

- Pretty much my first time using he Leaflet library for route building.
  Had to do some learning there.

- Was looking at building the core components as functional components.
    But realized that a class based approach will help prsent the solution in a scalable way at least from my own view.

- I had not used the browser Drag'n'Drop API before.
  It seemed to work pretty well in Firefox,
  but then I discovered it not quite working when testing in other browsers.
  Turned out I had used the deprecated dragexit event.
  Additionally I had problems with excessive dragleave events being fired,
  which I fixed with applying `pointer-events: none` to child elements.
  
- Overall, it was a very intersting exercise, givig me more insights towards innovating around map based products.
